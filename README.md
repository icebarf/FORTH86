# FORTH86

FORTH86 is an implementation of forthress, a FORTH dialect as described in Igor Zhirkov's Low Level Programming. This implementation is currently a work in progress, which I hopefully will finish by the end of January 2023.

Please report any bugs that you find, the interpreter is still in its early/alpha stage.

Happy hacking! üòÅ
